# ReactNodeSql

ReactNodeSQL is a web application that connects to a MySQL database using NodeJS. It allows you to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT. The project utilizes the Express module for handling HTTP requests and the MySQL module for database connectivity.

## Features

- Establishes a connection with a MySQL database using NodeJS.
- Implements GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT methods to interact with the database.
- Renders database data using ReactJS and manages changes, additions, and deletions using state management.
- Provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the database directly from the web application.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- NodeJS: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side.
- Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for NodeJS.
- MySQL: A popular relational database management system.
- JavaScript: The programming language used for both frontend and backend development.
